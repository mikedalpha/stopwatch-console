# Stopwatch Design

This simple console app written in C# simulates a **stopwatch** by following Mosh Hamedani's [Intermediate C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/) course.

It uses two methods, *Start* and *Stop*. When the stopwatch is stopped, it displays the time elapsed on the console.
